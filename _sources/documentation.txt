Documentation pointers
======================

This documentation you're now reading (at http://ddsc.github.com/) is the main
overview of the project. There is more information elsewhere that we haven't
duplicated. Here's a list of the most handy pointers:

- https://github.com/ddsc/ddsc-project/issues?labels=Requirement

  The full list of (Dutch) high-level requirements from the official list. We
  can use that to link to and from the actual work that we do (issues or
  commits) to these requirements. This gives a clear connection between
  functionality and requirements.

- https://lizard-developer-docs.readthedocs.org contains the most basic
  documentation for developers.

- https://sft.fugro.com is where all shared documents live (restricted access,
  project member only). You can find the *offerte* and the original spec here.
